This is the project I've prepared for the exam _Computing Methods for Experimental Physics and Data Analysis_ during a.y. 2020-2021.

### Abstract
The goal of this project is to train a DNN to play _Connect 4_. Although the game has been completely solved many years ago, it still offers a really interesting environment where training and testing neural networks. First of all, I've implemented a game engine that allows to play games and tournaments between players based on many different classical strategies. after that, I've used the data collected from many games between known agent, in order to train a convolutional neural network with supervised learning. In the end I've explored reinforcement learning techniques to create a neural network that is able to play without relying on external agent for training.
